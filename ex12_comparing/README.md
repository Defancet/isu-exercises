## Overview

Practical exercises and examples to understand the operations involving decimal numbers, particularly using `float`
and `double` parameters in assembly language. Emphasis is placed on comparing floating-point numbers and understanding
the behavior and application of different floating-point instructions.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Floating-Point Comparison

Develop a program that reads two floating-point numbers, compares them using FCOMI, and prints the larger number.

### Task 2: Handling Special Floating-Point Values

Create a function that returns the maximum value from an array of `float` numbers, properly handling special values like
minus infinity and NaN.

### Task 3: Parameter Passing for `double`

Implement a function that sums two `double` numbers passed by value and another version passed by reference,
demonstrating the handling of 64-bit data on the stack.

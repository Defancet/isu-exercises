## Overview

Rxplores the handling of decimal numbers using the mathematical coprocessor and the IEEE 754 standard for
floating-point arithmetic. You will learn how floating-point numbers are represented and manipulated at the hardware
level using the FPU's specialized instruction set.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Floating-Point Arithmetic

Perform operations on floating-point numbers and explore the effects of arithmetic underflows, overflows, and rounding.

### Task 2: FPU Stack Operations

Manipulate the FPU stack and understand the order of operations and their effects on program behavior.

### Task 3: Data Conversion

Convert decimal numbers to floating-point representations and vice versa, understanding the precision and limitations.

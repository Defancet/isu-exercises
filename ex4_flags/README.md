## Overview

This exercises focused on the manipulation of processor flags, and the implementation of shifts, rotations,
multiplication, and division operations in assembly language. It is designed to help understand the underlying
mechanics of how these operations affect the state of a processor and how they can be used to perform more complex
computations.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Flag Register

- Explore how operation results affect the EFLAGS register.
- Understand flags like Overflow (OF), Carry (CF), Sign (SF), and Zero (ZF).

### Task 3: Arithmetic Operations

- Practice adding and subtracting operations that affect the Carry Flag (CF).
- Implement and test addition, subtraction, and ADC (add with carry) instructions.

### Task 4: Shifts and Rotations

- Implement SHL (shift left), SHR (shift right), and their arithmetic versions SAL and SAR.
- Explore rotation instructions like ROL (rotate left) and ROR (rotate right).

### Task 5: Multiplication and Division

- Use IMUL and MUL for signed and unsigned multiplication.
- Handle results split across two registers and understand the errors like overflow.
- Implement and test division with IDIV and DIV, handling both quotient and remainder.

### Task 6: Practical Applications

- Apply learned concepts to solve problems, like calculating expressions or simulating simple algorithms.
- Each task will include debugging sessions to observe changes in register and flag states.

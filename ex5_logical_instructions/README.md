## Overview

This assembly language exercises designed to introduce students to logical instructions,
manipulation of the program counter, and the implementation of conditional logic. These exercises will help
understand the control flow and data manipulation at a low level, which are critical in system programming and embedded
systems development.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Logical Instructions

- Explore logical operations AND, OR, XOR, NOT and their impact on register values.
- Modify individual bits using logical operations to learn bitwise manipulation.

### Task 2: Program Counter

- Understand the function of the program counter in controlling the flow of execution.
- Implement unconditional jumps and observe how they affect program behavior.

### Task 3: Conditional Jumps

- Implement conditional jumps based on specific flag settings such as Zero (Z), Carry (C), Sign (S), and Overflow (O).
- Develop programs that use conditional logic to control execution flow, simulating simple `if-else` conditions.

### Task 4: Complex Conditional Structures

- Build complex conditions using nested `if-else` and `else-if` constructs.
- Manipulate conditions based on multiple criteria and observe how assembly handles short-circuit evaluation.

### Task 5: Practical Applications

- Apply logical and conditional instructions to solve practical problems like data filtering, user input processing, and
  simple decision-making algorithms.

## Overview

This exercises focuses on the use of global variables, arrays, and index registers in programming with the x86 processor
family in 32-bit mode. The exercises included demonstrate how to define, manipulate, and address variables and arrays in
low-level programming using assembly language.

## Tasks

1. **Task1**:
    - Manipulate and display values of initialized and uninitialized variables.
    - Basic input/output operations.

2. **Task2**:
    - Perform arithmetic operations on variables and manipulate data using assembly language.

3. **Task3**:
    - Array manipulations involving arithmetic computations and displaying results in a debugger.

4. **Task4**:
    - Advanced array operations, focusing on cumulative additions and memory segment operations.

5. **Task5**:
    - String manipulation: read, modify, and output strings using basic assembly commands.

## Overview

This assembly language exercises focused on implementing loops and string instructions. The tasks cover various looping
constructs such as `while`, `do-while`, and `for`, along with an exploration of string and chain instructions in
assembly to manipulate arrays and strings efficiently.

## Tasks

### Task 1: While Loops

- Implement `while` and `do-while` loops to understand basic iterative processes in assembly.

### Task 2: For Loops

- Use the `for` loop construct and the `LOOP` instruction to execute repetitive tasks, decrementing a counter until it
  reaches zero.

### Task 3: Chain Instructions

- Explore string operations with `MOVS`, `LODS`, `STOS`, `CMPS`, and `SCAS` instructions to manipulate data blocks
  between memory locations.

### Task 4: String Handling

- Use string instructions to perform operations such as copying, setting, comparing, and scanning strings within memory.

### Task 5: Practical Application

- Apply loops and string instructions to solve more complex problems, such as filtering inputs, processing text data, or
  building simple memory manipulation routines.

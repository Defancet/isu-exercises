## Overview

This repository contains a series of assembly language exercises designed to deepen understanding of low-level
programming concepts using the x86 processor family in 32-bit mode. The tasks cover a wide range of topics, including
basic arithmetic operations, data handling, program flow control, logical instructions, loops, string operations,
function calls, recursion, floating-point arithmetic, and more. Each task is designed to provide hands-on experience
with assembly language programming and to explore the underlying mechanics of processor operations.

## Exercises

1. **Exercise 2**: Processor, Development Tools, and Basics of Programming
2. **Exercise 3**: Global Variables, Arrays, and Index Registers
3. **Exercise 4**: Flags, Shifts, Rotations, Multiplication, and Division
4. **Exercise 5**: Logical Instructions, Program Counter, and Conditions
5. **Exercise 7**: Loops and String Instructions
6. **Exercise 8**: Functions, Register Backups, Stack Parameter Passing, and Local Variables
7. **Exercise 9**: Recursion, Calling Conventions, and External Functions
8. **Exercise 11**: Decimal Numbers, Mathematical Coprocessor, and Floating-Point Variables
9. **Exercise 12**: Comparing Decimal Numbers, `float` and `double` Parameters

## Tests

1. **Test 1**: Byte Swap and Signed Integer Arithmetic
2. **Test 2**: Search and Count in Array, Dynamic Array Manipulation
3. **Test 3**: Advanced Floating Point Arithmetic

## Setup and Execution

Each task is designed for 32-bit x86 processors and can be compiled with an assembly language compiler that supports the
Intel syntax. Detailed instructions for compiling and running each task are provided in the comments within the code
files in this repository.

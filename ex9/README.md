## Overview

This module explores advanced concepts in assembly language programming, focusing on recursion, different calling
conventions, and the use of external functions. These concepts are crucial for understanding the depth and flexibility
of low-level programming, particularly in how functions interact and how memory is managed dynamically.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Factorial Function

Implement a factorial function using recursion to deepen understanding of recursive stack frame usage.

### Task 2: Print Recursively

Create a function to print numbers recursively up and down to demonstrate the call stack behavior in recursive
functions.

### Task 3: Pyramid Number Calculation

Implement a recursive function to calculate pyramid numbers, showcasing recursive thinking and stack management.

### Task 4: External Library Interaction

Use external functions like `malloc`, `free`, and `printf` to perform dynamic memory management and output formatting.

### Task 5: Random Number Generation

Integrate C library functions to generate random numbers, illustrating the use of external functions in assembly
programs.

## Overview

Contains practical exercises and examples to understand the operations involving byte swapping and signed integer
arithmetic in assembly language. Emphasis is placed on rearranging bytes within a register and computing the quotient
and remainder of a given arithmetic expression.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Byte Swap in a Register

Create a function `task11` to rearrange the bytes within the EAX register.

### Task 2: Signed Integer Arithmetic

Create a function `task12` to compute both the quotient and remainder of a given arithmetic expression.

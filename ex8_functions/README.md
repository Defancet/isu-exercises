## Overview

This exercises and examples for assembly language programming focused on functions, managing registers, stack operations
for passing parameters, and the use of local variables. The exercises are designed to deepen understanding of how
low-level

## Tasks

### Task 1: Function Calls and Returns

- Understand the mechanism of function calls using `CALL` and `RET` instructions.
- Implement functions that double values and manage multiple function calls within the stack's operational scope.

### Task 2: Stack Operations

- Explore the stack's role in function parameter passing and local variable management.
- Examine how the stack grows downwards and how the `ESP` and `EBP` registers are used to manage function frames.

### Task 3: Parameter Passing

- Learn different methods for passing parameters to functions including register, memory, and stack-based strategies.
- Implement and test functions that use stack-passed parameters to perform calculations or manage data.

### Task 4: Local Variables

- Utilize the stack to allocate and manage local variables within functions.
- Develop understanding of the stack frame setup and teardown processes associated with function calls.

### Task 5: Register Backups

- Implement register saving and restoring techniques to prevent data loss during function execution.
- Develop functions that manipulate data while preserving the integrity of register contents.
